EPA GHGRP Ingetion Pipeline
==============================
The EPA GHG Reporting Program (GHGRP) provides annual data on approximately 10,000 facilities that emit 25 kt CO2e or more per year, across all industries.  This ingestion pipeline marries [Global Legal Entity Identifier](https://www.gleif.org/en) information to reported and reporting company names, then makes the data more [tidy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html) (using a wide-to-long conversion) before ingesting into the Data Commons.

Now that our Open Metadata instance is up and running, it would be good to add metadata to this data and re-ingest.

If you have questions, please file [Issues](https://github.com/os-climate/EPA_GHGRP-ingest-pipelinee/issues).  If you have answers, please contribute [Pull Requests](https://github.com/os-climate/EPA_GHGRP-ingest-pipeline/pulls)!
